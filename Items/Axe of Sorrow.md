_Weapon (any axe), rare (requires attunement)_<br><br>The **Axe of Sorrow** appears to be a normal axe, but upon closer inspection, a weeping face can be seen molded in the metal between the two blades.<br><br>_**Seeds of Sorrow.**_ When you first attune to it, this weapon has 3 charges and can hold up to 5 charges maximum. The axe regains 1 expended charge daily at midnight. While you wield it, you can use an action to expend one charge and target a creature within 30 feet of you. The target must make a DC 17 [Wisdom](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Wisdom "5e SRD:Wisdom") [saving throw](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Saving_Throws "5e SRD:Saving Throws"). On success, the target is immune to the effect for 12 hours. On failure, the target is overwhelmed with sorrow. At the beginning of each of its turns, the creature must roll a d4, performing an action as detailed below. While performing one of these actions, a creature's speed is reduced to 0, and it can't take actions or reactions.<br><br>1. The creature weeps.<br>2. The creature wallows in self-pity.<br>3. The creature screams loudly.<br>4. The creature forsakes all their belongings. They remove all of their valuables, such as weapons, scrolls, and gold pieces, and lay them on the ground at their feet.<br><br>If you attack the target, or another creature attacks it with this weapon, while Seeds of Sorrow is active, the effect ends immediately for that creature. Once this effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. An affected creature can make another [Wisdom](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Wisdom "5e SRD:Wisdom") saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. The effect otherwise lasts for 1 minute. You can affect up to 5 creatures with this effect at once but must target each creature with a separate action and another charge.<br><br>_**Pitiful Wail**_ While attuned to the axe, you can let out a wail that causes creatures around you to pity you. It is weak, feeble cry for help, and makes other creatures pity you. As an action, you can force every creature within 60 feet of you tha tcan hear you to make a DC 17 [Wisdom](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Wisdom "5e SRD:Wisdom") [saving throw](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Saving_Throws "5e SRD:Saving Throws") or become charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, creatures will treat you as lesser than them, but will help you if you need it. They will protect you, but will not risk their life doing so. If you ask any charmed creatures to do anything obviously dangerous, the effect ends on them, and any other creatures who heard you making that request can remake the [Wisdom](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Wisdom "5e SRD:Wisdom") save, ending the effect on themselves on a success. Once used, this property can't be used until you finish a short or long rest.<br><br>_**Curse.**_ Once you attune to this weapon, you cannot unattune to it, and always keep it by your side. Creatures attuned to this axe are viewed by others as a creature deserving of pity and are always looked down upon. They also have [disadvantage](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Disadvantage "5e SRD:Disadvantage") on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws using [Charisma](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Charisma "5e SRD:Charisma"). If you are targeted by a spell such as _[greater restoration](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Greater_Restoration "5e SRD:Greater Restoration")_ that can remove a curse, as long as the spell is 5th level or higher, your attunement to the axe ends.|
