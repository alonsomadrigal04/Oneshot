Blessing of Protä: As long as you have the ascension ring equipped, you can use one of its charges. Add 2d6 Lightning Damage to your next successful melee attack roll. 
In addition, all creatures within 15 feets of the target will have to roll a 15 dexterity saving throw or take 2d4 lightning damage.

You only get one charge and it recharges every sunrise.

Korsik's Curse: This ring is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with a [Remove Curse](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:remove-curse) spell or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the ring.
